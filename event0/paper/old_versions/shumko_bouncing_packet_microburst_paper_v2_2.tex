\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}
% use \citet for direct references, \citep for indirect.
The dynamics of radiation belt electrons are complex, and are driven by competition between source and loss processes. A few possible loss processes are radial diffusion \citep{Shprits2004}, magnetopause shadowing \citep{Ukhorskiy2006}, and pitch angle \added{and energy} diffusion due to \added{scattering of electrons by} plasma waves \citep[e.g.][]{Abel1998_1, Summers1998, Meredith2002, Selesnick2003, Horne2003, Thorne2005}. \deleted{and Coulomb scattering.} \deleted{As described in [Millan and Thorne, 2007; Thorne, 2010] and references contained within,} There are a variety of waves that cause pitch angle scattering, including electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, plasmaspheric hiss, and \deleted{whistler-mode} chorus \citep{Millan2007, Thorne2010}. \deleted{Whistler-mode} Chorus predominantly occurs in the dawn sector \added{(6-12 magnetic local times (MLT))}\citep{Li2009} where it accelerates electrons with large equatorial pitch angles and scatters electrons with small equatorial pitch angles \citep{Horne2003}. Some of these electrons may be impulsively scattered into the loss cone, \replaced{This sudden increase (duration ${\approx} 100$ ms) in precipitating electron flux is believed to be caused by scattering with whistler-mode chorus waves}{where they result in short-duration ($\sim 100$ ms) enhancements in precipitating flux called microbursts.}

\deleted{Microbursts were first termed by} \citet{Anderson1964} \added{coined the term microburst to describe high altitude balloon observations of $\sim 100$ ms enhancements of} \deleted{who used high altitude balloon observations of} bremsstrahlung X-rays emitted from scattered \added{microburst} electrons impacting the atmosphere. Since then, \added{non-relativistic} microbursts have routinely been observed with other balloon missions \citep{Parks1967, Woodger2015, Anderson2017}. \added{Interestingly,} relativistic microbursts have not yet been observed by high altitude balloons in the dawn sector \citep{Millan2002, Millan2007}. \replaced{, which may be caused by a pitch angle anisotropy of relativistic microbursts due to relatively weaker pitch angle scattering of relativistic electrons by chorus }{This may be due to relatively weaker pitch angle scattering of relativistic electrons by chorus} \citep{Lee2012}. Microbursts have also been observed in low earth orbit (LEO) with, e.g. the SAMPEX \added{> 150 keV} and > 1 MeV channels \citep{Nakamura1995, Nakamura2000, Blake1996, Lorentzen2001a, Lorentzen2001b, O'Brien2003, O'Brien2004, Blum2015} and FIREBIRD-II with its > 200 keV energy channels \citep{Crew2016, Anderson2017, Breneman2017}. Microbursts and chorus waves predominantly occur in the dawn sector, are bursty \citep{Lorentzen2001b}, \replaced{and observationally Breneman et al. [2017] directly linked microbursts scattered by whistler-mode chorus}{and \citet{Breneman2017} made a direct observational link between microbursts and chorus.} 

Understanding microburst precipitation is important to radiation belt dynamics since they have been modeled and empirically estimated to deplete the relativistic electron population of the outer radiation belt on \replaced{time scales of hours to a few days}{the order of a day} \citep{O'Brien2004, Thorne2005, Shprits2007, Breneman2017}. An important parameter in the estimation of instantaneous radiation belt electron losses due to microbursts is their scale size. \citet{Parks1967} used balloon measurements of bremsstrahlung X-rays to estimate the scale size of predominantly low energy microbursts \replaced{as}{to be} $40 \pm 14$ km. In \citet{Blake1996} a microburst with multiple bounces \added{was} observed by  SAMPEX, \added{and the microburst} was estimated to have a latitudinal scale size of ``at least a few tens of kilometers". \replaced{and they}{\citet{Blake1996}} concluded that typically microbursts are less than a few tens of electron gyroradii in size (at L = 5 at LEO, the gyroradii of 1 MeV electrons is on the order of 100 m). \citet{Dietrich2010} used SAMPEX along with ground-based very low frequency stations to conclude that microbursts have scale sizes less than $4$ km.

Since February 1st, 2015, microbursts have been observed by FIREBIRD-II, a pair of CubeSats in LEO. Soon after launch, when the two FIREBIRD-II spacecraft were at close range, a microburst with a scale size greater than 11 km was observed \citep{Crew2016}. On the same day, \added{FIREBIRD-II simultaneously observed} a microburst with multiple bounces. \deleted{was simultaneously observed on both spacecraft.} The microburst decay was observed over a period of a few seconds, while the spacecraft were traveling predominantly in latitude. \replaced{The analysis in this paper uses FIREBIRD-II to resolve the spatial and temporal properties of the first microburst with multiple bounces observed with two spacecraft.}{Here we present the analysis and results of the latitude and longitude scale sizes of the first microburst with multiple bounces observed with two spacecraft.}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section \ref{obs}, we introduce the spacecraft instrumentation and the microburst observation. In section \ref{analysis}, we describe the calculation of the microburst scale size in LEO and at the magnetic equator, as well as the electron bounce period. Lastly, in section \ref{discussion}, \replaced{these results will be tied to the current empirical and theoretical understanding of microbursts and their connection to the chorus scale sizes.}{we compare the microburst scale size results to empirical estimates of chorus scale sizes.} 

\section{Spacecraft and Observation} \label{obs} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FIREBIRD-II is a pair of identically-instrumented 1.5U CubeSats (15 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) that are \replaced{termed}{designed to measure electron precipitation in LEO. The FIREBIRD-II CubeSats are identified as} Flight Unit 3 (FU3) and Flight Unit 4 (FU4) and were launched on January 31st, 2015. Their orbit has a 632 km apogee, 433 km perigee, and $99^{\circ}$ inclination \citep{Crew2016}. FU3 and FU4 are \replaced{flying}{orbiting} in a string of pearls configuration with FU4 ahead, to resolve the space-time ambiguity inherent to single spacecraft missions such as SAMPEX. Each FIREBIRD-II unit has a collimated and a surface solid state detector with complementary fields of view of $54^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$, respectively. They are observing electron fluxes in six energy channels from $\sim 230$ keV to $> 1$ MeV. Their adjustable sampling rate is 18.75 ms by default and can be at a fast as 12.5 ms. 

On February 2nd, 2015 at 06:12:53 UT, \added{during the transition between the main and recovery phases of a storm with a minimum Dst of -44 nT (Kp = 4, and AE ${\approx 400}$ nT)}, a microburst and subsequent bounces were observed simultaneously on both spacecraft. Figure \ref{hires_plot} shows the High Resolution (HiRes) microburst electron flux, sampled at 18.75 ms. Five peaks were observed on both spacecraft. FU3's collimated detector observed the microburst \added{from the first energy channel (231 - 300 keV) } to the fourth energy channel (555 - 771 keV), while on the surface detector it was observed up to the fifth energy channel (683 - 950 keV). Only FU3 has a functioning surface detector, \replaced{thus only data from the lowest four energy channels of the collimated detectors was used for this analysis.}{so the rest of this analysis used the electron flux data from the collimated detectors, up to the fourth energy channel.} Furthermore, since FU4's 5th peak in the fourth energy channel was \replaced{buried in}{comparable to the} Poisson noise, only the first four peaks \added{on FU4} were used in the spatial scale analysis. 

\added{The HiRes data in Fig. \ref{hires_plot} shows signs of energy dispersion. With the aid of the black vertical bars in Fig. \ref{hires_plot}, the first peak does not appear to be dispersed, and subsequent peaks show dispersion consistent across energy channels. This dispersion signature and amplitude decay implies that the first peak was observed soon after the electrons were scattered, followed by decaying bounces.}

\deleted{From the black vertical bars in Fig. \ref{hires_plot}, the first peak does not appear to be dispersed, and subsequent peaks show dispersion consistent across energy channels. This dispersion signature and amplitude decay implies that the first peak was observed soon after the electrons were scattered, followed by decaying bounces.} At this time, FIREBIRD-II was \added{at McIlwain L = 4.7 and MLT = 8.3, calculated with the Tsyganenko 1989 (T89) magnetic field model \citep{Tsyganenko1989}. They were} above Sweden, latitude = $63^{\circ}$N, longitude = $15^{\circ}$E, altitude = 650 km. \replaced{at the eastern edge of the bounce loss cone (BLC). For this analysis, the BLC is defined as the region where locally mirroring electrons will mirror at an altitude less than 100 km in the opposite hemisphere, and could be lost due to collisions in the atmosphere [\textit{Abel and Thorne, 1998}]. This unique observation of returning bounces was possible since FIREBIRD-II was at the eastern edge of the BLC;}{At this location,} any background electron flux that was in the drift loss cone was recently lost to the South Atlantic Anomaly, \added{enabling FIREBIRD-II to make this unique observation}. \replaced{In the drift loss cone, any returning bounces from microbursts will be quickly hidden in the background electron flux.}{Outside of this region, the drift loss cone flux will quickly hide the returning bounces.} Locally mirroring electrons would have mirrored at 95 km in the opposite hemisphere, calculated with T89 and IRBEM-Lib \citep{irbem}. From the analysis done by \citet{Fang2010}, the peak \added{in the} total ionization rate in the atmosphere for 100 keV electrons is around 80 km altitude, while 1 MeV electrons have a peak total ionization rate around 60 km altitude, so it is expected that a fraction of the microburst electrons will survive each encounter with the atmosphere. By plotting the peak flux as a function of bounce \added{(not shown)}, it was found that 40 - 60 \% of the microburst electrons were lost on the first bounce, similar to the 33\% loss per bounce observed for a bouncing microburst observed by SAMPEX \citep{Thorne2005}. 

\deleted{The geomagnetic conditions at the time were Kp = 4, AE ${\approx 400}$ nT and DST = -44 nT, during the transition between the main and recovery phases of a geomagnetic storm. At the time of the microburst, FIREBIRD-II was at McIlwain L = 4.7 and MLT = 8.3, calculated with the T89 model.}

\section{Analysis} \label{analysis} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\added{At the beginning of the FIREBIRD-II mission, two issues prevented the proper analysis of the microburst's spatial scale size: the spacecraft clocks were not synchronized, and their relative positions were not accurately known. We addressed these issues with a cross-correlation time lag analysis described in detail in the supporting information. From this analysis, the time correction was $2.28 \pm 0.12$ s (applied to Fig. \ref{hires_plot}) and the separation was $d = 19.9 \pm 0.9$ km.}

\subsection{Microburst Scale Sizes} \label{scale_size} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%With the spacecraft orbit, corrected separation, and timeseries from Fig. \ref{hires_plot}, a map \added{of FU3's and FU4's locations during this event} in longitude-latitude \deleted{was made and} is shown in Fig. \ref{map_plot}. 

\replaced{With the spacecraft orbit, corrected separation, and timeseries from Fig. \ref{hires_plot}, a map in longitude-latitude was made and is shown in Fig. \ref{map_plot}.}{After we applied the corrections detailed in the supporting information, we mapped the locations of FU3 and FU4 in Fig. \ref{map_plot}.} The locations where FU3 saw peaks 1-5 and where FU4 saw peaks 1-4 are shown as P1-5 and P1-4, respectively. The lower bound on the latitudinal extent of the microburst was the difference in latitude between P1 on FU3 and P4 on FU4 and was found to be $28.8 \pm 0.8$ km. The uncertainty was estimated from the spacecraft separation uncertainty \replaced{calculated in section \ref{corrections}}{described in the supporting information}. This scale size is the largest reported by FIREBIRD-II.

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Need to reword the following sentence...}} To calculate the longitudinal scale size of the microburst, it is assumed that \added{the scattered} electrons observed in the last bounce by FIREBIRD-II, must have \replaced{begun drifting when the initial microburst was observed, to the}{drifted from their initial scattering longitude,} west of \replaced{the spacecraft}{FIREBIRD-II's location}. Following geometrical arguments, the distance that electrons drift azimuthally in a single bounce is a product of the circumference of the drift shell foot point, and the fraction of the total drift orbit traversed in a single bounce and is given by, 

\begin{equation}
d_{az} = 2 \pi (R_E + A) \cos(\lambda) \frac{t_b}{<T_{d}>}
\label{bounce_drift}
\end{equation} where $R_E$ is the Earth's radius, $A$ is the spacecraft altitude, $\lambda$ is the magnetic latitude, $t_b$ is the electron bounce period, and $<T_{d}>$ is the electron drift period. \citet{Parks2003} derived $<T_{d}>$ to be,
\begin{equation}
<T_{d}> \approx
\begin{cases}
43.8 /(L \cdot E) & \text{if } \alpha_0 = 90^{\circ} \\    62.7/(L \cdot E) & \text{if } \alpha_0 = 0^{\circ}
\end{cases}
\label{drift}
\end{equation} where E is the electron energy in MeV, L is the L shell, and $\alpha_0$ is the equatorial pitch angle. Electrons mirroring at FIREBIRD-II have $\alpha_0 {\approx} 3.7^{\circ}$ and so the $\alpha_0 = 0^{\circ}$ limit was used.

The microburst's longitudinal scale size is defined as the furthest distance that its electrons drifted east and were last seen. This was calculated with $D_{az} = n \ d_{az}$ where $n$ is the number of bounces observed. The stars with energy labels in Fig. \ref{map_plot} represent the locations of electrons with that energy when the microburst was \replaced{seen}{observed} at P1, and drifted eastward to be last seen at P5 for FU3 and P4 for FU4. Using this methodology, the \added{the larger} longitudinal scale size was \added{observed by FU3 and it was} greater than $ 38.5 \pm 8.8$ km for the 555 keV electrons and greater than $ 50.8 \pm 11.4$ km for the 771 keV electrons, and is shown with the red dashed box in Fig. \ref{map_plot}. The uncertainty was estimated by propagating the uncertainty in the spacecraft separation through Eq. \ref{bounce_drift}.

The \added{microburst's} longitudinal and latitudinal scale sizes and their uncertainties at LEO were mapped to the magnetic equator with T89. The radial scale size (latitudinal scale mapped from LEO) was greater than $504 \pmâ€‹ 14$ km. The azimuthal scale size (longitudinal scale mapped from LEO) of 555 keV electrons was greater than $451 \pm 103$ km and for the 771 keV electrons it was greater than $530 \pm 119$ km.

\subsection{Electron Bounce Period} \label{t_b} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\replaced{Lastly, the observed bounce period, $t_b$ as a function of energy was calculated. To calculate the observed $t_b$ and uncertainties, the raw HiRes flux was baseline-subtracted and fitted.}{We used this unique observation of bouncing electrons to calculate the bounce period, $t_b$ as a function of energy and compare it to $t_b$ derived from four magnetic field models. The observed $t_b$ and uncertainties were calculated by fitting the baseline-subtracted HiRes flux.} The baseline flux used in this analysis is given in \citet{O'Brien2004} as the flux at the 10th percentile over a specified time interval, which in this analysis was taken to be 0.5 seconds. The flux was fitted with a superposition of Gaussians for each energy channel, \replaced{The}{and} the uncertainty in flux \replaced{is}{was calculated} using the Poisson error from the microburst and baseline fluxes summed in quadrature. Using the fit parameters, the mean $t_b$ for the lowest four energy channels \replaced{was calculated and}{is} shown in Fig. \ref{tb_plot} with green and purple rectangles. \added{The trend of decreasing $t_b$ as a function of energy is evident in Fig. \ref{tb_plot}. This energy dispersion signature further supports the assumption that the subsequent peaks are bounces, and not a train of microbursts scattered by bouncing chorus.} 

The bounces observed with FU3 had in-channel dispersion to earlier times in the lowest two energy channels \added{(evident by the skewing of the observed peaks)}. This \added{dispersion signature} hints at the underlying \replaced{distribution of electron flux within those energy channels.}{electron flux spectra that is smeared out by the broad energy channels, and appears as skewing in the observed peaks.} If FIREBIRD-II had finer energy resolution, the peak in the flux would be towards the \replaced{upper}{higher energy} end of the first energy channel. A Gaussian fit cannot account for this in-channel dispersion, and as a first order correction, minima between peaks was used to calculate $t_b$, and is shown in Fig. \ref{tb_plot} with blue rectangles. \deleted{The observed energy-dependent dispersion shown in Fig. \ref{tb_plot} is consistent with higher energy peaks returning sooner. This dispersion consistency further supports the assumption that the subsequent peaks are bounces, and not a train of microbursts scattered by bouncing chorus.}

\added{To compare the observed and modeled $t_b$, we} superposed \deleted{in Fig. \ref{tb_plot}, are} $t_b$ curves for various models including an analytical solution in a dipole \citep{Schulz1974}, and numerical models: T89, Tsyganenko 2004 (T04) \citep{Tsyganenko2005}, and Olson \& Pfitzer Quiet \citep{Olson1982} \added{in Fig. \ref{tb_plot}}. The numerical $t_b$ curves were calculated using a Python wrapper for IRBEM-Lib. It traces the magnetic field line between mirror points, and calculates $t_b$ assuming conservation of energy and the first adiabatic invariant for electrons mirroring at FIREBIRD-II. A discrepancy of ${\approx} 20 \%$ is present between the modeled and fit bounce periods in the lower energies, and is reduced at higher energies. The low energy discrepancy is removed by using the minima to calculate $t_b$ for the < 555 keV peaks. Across all but one energy channel, the T04 model has the largest discrepancy compared to other models.

\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}
The twin FIREBIRD-II CubeSats have enabled a direct estimate of the lower bound scale size of the large microburst studied here. This microburst was larger than the latitudinal scale sizes of > 1 MeV microbursts reported in \citet{Blake1996}, \replaced{and}{was} similar to the scale sizes of > 15 keV microbursts observed with a high altitude balloon \citep{Parks1967} \added{and was $\sim 10$ times larger than reported in \citet{Dietrich2010}. Lastly, the microburst studied here \replaced{had a scale size}{was} $\sim 2.6$ times larger than other simultaneous microbursts observed by FIREBIRD-II \citep{Crew2016}.} \deleted{Furthermore, the latitudinal scale size in this study was roughly $\sim 2.6$ times larger than other simultaneous microbursts reported in \textit{Crew et al.} [2016] and $\sim 10$ times larger than than reported in \textit{Dietrich et al.} [2010]} No energy dependence on the scale size was observed.

The microburst scale size obtained in Section \ref{scale_size} and scaled to the geomagnetic equator can be compared with the scales of chorus waves presumably responsible for the rapid burst electron precipitation. Early direct estimates of the chorus source scales were made by the coordinated measurement by ISEE-1, 2. The wave power correlation scale was estimated to be about several hundred kilometers across the background magnetic field \citep{Gurnett1979}. \citet{Santolik2003} determined the correlation lengths of chorus-type whistler waves to be around 100 km based on multipoint CLUSTER \replaced{WBD}{Wide Band Data} measurements near the chorus source region during the magnetic storm of 18 April 2002 at L shell about 4. \citet{Agapitov2010, Agapitov2011b, Agapitov2017a} recently showed that the spatial extent of chorus source region can be larger: from ~600 km in the outer radiation belt to more than 1000 km in the outer magnetosphere. The lower bound azimuthal and latitudinal scales obtained in Section \ref{scale_size} and scaled to the magnetic equator, are similar to the whistler-mode chorus source scale sizes reported in \citet{Agapitov2011b, Agapitov2017a}. 

No wave measurements from nearby spacecraft were available at this time. \deleted{to confirm the presence of chorus} \added{Nevertheless, during the hours before and after this observation, the Van Allen Probes' \citep{Mauk2013} Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument and Integrated Science \citep{Kletzing2013} observed strong wave power in the lower band chorus frequency range, inside the outer radiation belt between 22 and 2 MLT}. \replaced{Nevertheless}{Furthermore}, AE $\sim 400$ nT at this time, and relatively strong chorus waves were statistically more likely to be present \added{at FIREBIRD-II's MLT} \citep{Li2009}. \added{With the evidence presented, we conclude that} the microburst electrons were likely scattered by chorus, similar to the conclusions made by e.g. \citet{Lorentzen2001a, O'Brien2003, Breneman2017}.

\added{The empirically estimated and modeled $t_b$ in this study agree within FIREBIRD-II's uncertainties. This agreement implies that the real and modeled magnetic field line lengths are comparable. This is expected since the magnetoshere is not drastically compressed at 8 MLT, but we expect a larger discrepancy near midnight, where the magnetosphere is more stretched. This analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for validating field line lengths in future studies.}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{This paragraph seems out of place...}}
\added{Lastly, we investigated the energy spectra of this microburst.} Using the fit parameters from section \ref{t_b}, \added{we calculated} the exponential E-folding energy, \deleted{$E_0$ was calculated to be} $E_0 \sim 100 \ keV$. This is similar to the results in \citet{Lee2005} who used STSAT-1 and \citet{Datta1997} who used a sounding rocket. It is soft for a typical microburst observed with FIREBIRD-II. There was no statistically significant change in $E_0$ for subsequent bounces.

\section{Conclusions}
This was a first observation of a large microburst with multiple bounces made possible by the twin FIREBIRD-II CubeSats. Its lower bound LEO latitudinal and longitudinal scale sizes of $28.8 \pm 0.8$ km and $ 50.8 \pm 11.4$  km make it one of the largest observed. No energy dependence on the scale size was observed. Furthermore, its lower bound LEO scale sizes mapped to the magnetic equator were  $504 \pmâ€‹ 14$ km radially and $530 \pm 119$ km azimuthally. The bounce periods calculated with the Gaussian fit and minima methods are in good agreement with the numerically estimated bounce periods, confirming that the energy-dependent dispersion was due to bouncing. The similarity of the microburst and chorus source region scale sizes, as well as magnetospheric location and condition, \replaced{support the idea that microbursts are produced by electrons scattered by whistler-mode chorus waves.}{further support the correlation between microbursts and chorus.}

\caption{HiRes data of the microburst observed at February 2nd, 2015 at 06:12:53 UT, smoothed with a 150 ms rolling average. The subsequent bounces showed some energy dispersion. As discussed in the supporting information, a time correction of -2.28 s was applied to FU3. While the flux from five energy channels is shown, only channels with reasonable counting statistics were used for the spatial scale analysis. Vertical colored bars show the $\sqrt{N}$ error every 10th data point and vertical black bars are lined up with the peaks in the 220-283 keV energy channel to help identify dispersion.}

\caption{The topology of the FIREBIRD-II orbit and the multiple bounces of the microburst projected onto latitude and longitude with axis scaled to equal distance. Attributes relating to FU3 shown in red dashed lines, and FU4 with blue solid lines. The spacecraft path is shown with the diagonal lines, starting at the upper right corner. The labels P1-4 for FU4 and P1-5 for FU3 indicate where the spacecraft were when the N$^{th}$ peak was seen in the lowest energy channel in the HiRes data. The stars with the accompanying energy labels represent the locations of the electrons with that energy that started at time of P1, and were seen at the last peak on each spacecraft. The rectangles represent the lower bound of the microburst scale size, assuming that the majority of the electrons were in the upper boundary of energy channel 4.}

The red and cyan dashed lines are the $t_b$ derived using the T89, and T04 magnetic field models with IRBEM. Lastly, the blue dashed curve is the $t_b$ derived using the Olson \& Pfitzer Quiet model. The green and purple rectangles represent the observed $t_b$ for FU3 and FU4 using a Gaussian fit, respectively. The blue rectangles represent the observed $t_b$ calculated with the minima between the bounces. The width of the boxes represent the width of those energy channels, and the height represents the uncertainty from the fit.}

% Single-line equations are centered.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
